This is my personal portfolio website, created to present my technical skills, projects, professional experiences, hackathon participation, and achievements as a Computer Science Engineering student and aspiring software developer. The website reflects my learning journey, interests in full-stack development, and passion for building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

It serves as a central place to explore the projects I have worked on, understand the technologies I use, and get an overview of my growth through internships, training programs, and tech events. The portfolio is designed to be simple, modern, and easy to navigate across all devices.
